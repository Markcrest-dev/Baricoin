                <p>Baricoin Digital Technologies is committed to protecting your personal data and respecting your
                    privacy. We collect and process personal information in accordance with applicable data protection

                    Upon termination, your right to use the service will immediately cease. We may also refuse service
                    to anyone for any reason at any time. If your account is suspended or terminated, you may not create
